                    Varisu Review: Now Streaming On Prime Video, The Film Is A Templated Celebration Of The "Toxic"
                    Family
                    Ranjani Krishnakumar
                    Updated:22nd Feb, 2023 at 6:04 PM
                    Director: Vamshi Paidipally
                    Writers: Vamshi Paidipally, Hari, Ahishor Solomon
                    Cast: Vijay, Rashmika Mandanna, Shaam, Sarathkumar, Yogi Babu, Prakash Raj
                    The word ‚Äútoxic‚Äù in the headline, dear reader, isn‚Äôt my grandstanding judgment.</p>

                <p>It is Varisu‚Äôs only moment of self-awareness, the words written by Vivek (dialogues)
                    uttered by the film‚Äôs hero, Vijay himself. It‚Äôs also the off-handed acceptance of the message
                    that Varisu is going for: Even if toxic, to the point of being murderous, families are sacrosanct.
                    As you would surely have guessed by now, Varisu is the story of a family. At its head is the
                    controlling and competition-obsessed father, Rajendran (Sarathkumar), who also runs a business
                    conglomerate.

                    daughter
                    is a rebellious teenager, who smokes in the garden and leaves butts behind that apparently no one
                    sees or even smells ‚Äî perhaps the perils of living in a house that large!

                    vacuum created
                    by this silly family‚Äôs pointless antics, Varisu breaks into song and dance.
                    In the end, the message is clear: Every family is upheld by the silencing and
                    erasure of its women. Behind every victorious Varisu lies a million women's dead dreams and
                    happiness.</p>
